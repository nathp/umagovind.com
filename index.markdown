>I become the stars and the moon.
>I become the lover and the beloved.
>I become the victor and the vanquished.
>I become the master and the slave.
>I become the singer and the song.
>
>I become the knower and the known.
>I keep on dancing then it is the eternal dance or creation.
>The creator and creation merge into one wholeness of joy.
>I keep on dancing… and dancing… and dancing.
>
>Until there is only… the DANCE.
