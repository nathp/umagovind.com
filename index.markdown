I become the stars and the moon.
I become the lover and the beloved.
I become the victor and the vanquished.
I become the master and the slave.
I become the singer and the song.

I become the knower and the known.
I keep on dancing then it is the eternal dance or creation.
The creator and creation merge into one wholeness of joy.
I keep on dancing… and dancing… and dancing.

Until there is only… the DANCE.
