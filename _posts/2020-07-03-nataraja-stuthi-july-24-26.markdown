This is the third workshop as part of **[Nrtya Kalpanaa Series](/nrtya-kalpanaa-workshops)**.
The item begins with the Chidambareshwara Stotram followed by a Jathi. The lyrics of the kriti is from the point of view of a devotee praising the Lord Nataraja of Chidambaram.

It is a piece describing the Thandava Dance of Lord Shiva. The concept of Ardhanareeshwara and Navarasa are also explored in this.
