Uma conducts Bharata Natyam workshops online where a new choreography will be taught to interested students.   













Workshops usually last 2 to 3 days, with each session being approx 1 hour and 30 minute duration. 







You will be given the audio and video of the item. You can use the audio to perform for events.  You are expected to send video of your performance within a week after the workshop. Individual guidance will be provided based on this video.







You should have at least a basic exposure to Bharata Natyam (or a similar classical dance form) to make the best use of this workshop.  







There is a _Dakshina_ to participate in the workshop.
