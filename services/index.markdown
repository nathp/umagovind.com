#### Learn Bharata Natyam via Online classes
I conduct Bharatanatyam classes Online. Classes open for beginners and seniors. Please get in touch to know more.<br><br>

#### Learn Items via Online Workshops
  I conduct Online workshops periodically where participants can learn Bharata Natyam items. This is open to anyone who has at least a basic exposure to Bharata Natyam.  Audio and video of the items will be provided.  The audio can be used to perform in other venues.  

  A workshop usually needs 2 to 3 sessions, with each session being approximately 1 hour 30 minutes in duration.  Workshops are usually scheduled on weekends. You are encouraged to send in a video of your performance once you have learned the item. Individual guidance will be provided based on the video.  


  See [Nrtya Kalpanaa series Online workshops](/nrtya-kalpanaa-workshops) for details of upcoming programs.

>I really enjoyed the workshop because for me it was a good push and a motivation to get back to dancing and practicing. Even though it was only a 3hr workshop, the item was so well broken into parts and each of the part explained in detail, helping us to be deeply involved in the progress of the pushpanjali.
